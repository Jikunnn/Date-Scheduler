##Date Scheduler Web Application Using NextJS

This application serves to be a date scheduler when you want to ask someone out on a date. It asks for the name, email, type of date they want, and date and time of the said date.

- Learning NextJS and React at the same time with this application.
- Planning to add Email Functionality as well as a basic database for storing data using MongoDB.
- Will try to update the functionalities mentioned above soon.
